## MEDIA_PREDICTION_JUPYTERNOTEBOOK
This work was developed by João Barão and Marta Longo for EIACD class in college, 2 semester, 1 year.

## THE PROJECT
Nowdays we consume tons of content on the Internet. There are so many options that sometimes we get indecisive. If only there was a Data Set that could predict if a album, movie or TV series is bad, mediocre, good or excellent... In this notebook we will show you that Data Science can be used in pratical ways to make our life easier and enjoyable.
The task that was given to us consisted on making predictions of media (movies, albuns and tv-shows), classifing them as good, bad or excellent.
To make this project we used tools and algorithmns that the teacher taught in class. We also turned to other worksheets from previous classes.
Examples of what we used:
- K-NN
- Decision Tree
- Cross Validation
